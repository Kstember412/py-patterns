# Python Patterns
This repository contains a learning exercise with 15 pattern printing functions of increasing complexity, designed for Python developers to practice string manipulation, loops, and formatting.

## Project Structure
- `print_patterns.py`: Implementation file with TODOs
- `test_print_patterns.py`: Unit tests for all patterns
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow

## Patterns Included

1. Simple triangle (pattern_1)
2. Number line (pattern_2)
3. Square of stars (pattern_3)
4. Reverse triangle (pattern_4)
5. Number column (pattern_5)
6. Centered triangle (pattern_6)
7. Number pyramid (pattern_7)
8. Reverse number pyramid (pattern_8)
9. Diamond pattern (pattern_9)
10. Number square (pattern_10)
11. Pascal's triangle (pattern_11)
12. Hollow triangle (pattern_12)
13. Hollow square (pattern_13)
14. Hollow diamond (pattern_14)
15. Number diamond (pattern_15)

Each pattern includes a docstring showing the expected output for n=3 (or n=4 for pattern_15).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b your-feature-branch`
3. Implement the patterns in `patterns.py`
4. Test locally: `python test_patterns.py`
5. Commit and push your changes
6. Create a Pull Request to main

## Development Workflow
- The main branch is protected
- All changes must come through Pull Requests
- PRs trigger automatic testing via GitHub Actions
- Tests must pass before merging

## Running Tests

```bash
python test_patterns.py
```

## Learning Objectives
- Basic string manipulation
- Loop control structures
- String formatting and spacing
- Pattern recognition
- Unit testing basics

## Tips
- Start with pattern_1 and work your way up
- Use the docstrings as visual guides
- Test each pattern individually
- Use print() statements for debugging
- Pay attention to spacing and newlines

Good luck!
